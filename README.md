# Website Template for Personal Website

This is a short website for showing my academic carrier and presenting my work. However, this is so far only a template since I did not give any personal information yeat but rather created a template for this. Hence, the different links and the message function do not work properly. I included some reactive elements as a kind of minigame with some easter eggs you can explore. Try to click on moving elements which seem to be reactive and explore the template! You can open this website in a preview via github but there are some problems with using the javascript file. So, it is recommended to download or clone the repository.
